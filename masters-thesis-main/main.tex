%% as complete a template as possible to let you focus
%% on the most important part: the writing itself.
%% Thus the details regarding the visual appearance

%% I sincerely hope you will find this template useful
%% in completing your thesis project. I've tried to

%% Just refrain from editing it in the most crucial
%% versions of the thesis!
%%
%% I wish you and your thesis project the best of luck!
